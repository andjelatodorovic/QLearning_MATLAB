# QLearning_MATLAB
###### Some basic exercises and algorithms of Reinforcement learning, including Feed Forward, Backpropagation, Gradient descent etc.

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of Q-learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances. It does not require a model of the environment, and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.
